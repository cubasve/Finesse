# Finesse

## Description:

Finesse is based off of the book Increase Your Financial IQ by Robert Kiyosaki. It implements the diagrams in the book and has additional features added onto them.

Finesse aims to simplify financial jargon so it is easy to understand and it aims to teach financial literacy using financial statements.


- Users from all different knowledge backgrounds can use this
- Demystifies/simplifies financial jargon so everyone can understand key concepts
- Includes the idea of "paying yourself first" with every paycheque before paying other expenses --> it ensures that the user to prioritize their financial future before their payees
The important takeaway about paying yourself first is to make a habit out of it. The percentage is not important. It could even be as little as 1% of your income. As your income increases, increase the percentage accordingly. The habit of doing so is the key takeaway.

- Introduces different types of income, assets and liabilities
- Introduces terms with easy definitions so everyone can understand
- IF I HAVE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS: Shows the connection between the 3 financial statements
