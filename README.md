# Finesse

## Description:
- Users from all different knowledge backgrounds can use this
- Demystifies/simplifies financial jargon so everyone can understand key concepts
- Includes the idea of "paying yourself first" with every paycheque before paying other expenses --> it ensures that the user to prioritize their financial future before their payees
The important takeaway about paying yourself first is to make a habit out of it. The percentage is not important. It could even be as little as 1% of your income. As your income increases, increase the percentage accordingly. The habit of doing so is the key takeaway.

- Introduces different types of income, assets and liabilities
- Introduces terms with easy definitions so everyone can understand
- IF I HAVE TIME TO IMPLEMENT THIS: Shows the connection between the 3 financial statements


### Background Info:

- It is great that it is being incorporated into the curriculum, but ....

- A publicly traded company has 3 financial statements (income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement) which is recorded on a monthly quarterly and anual basis 
- This application uses the same 3 financial statements for individuals

## Next Steps: Planned Future Enhancements







This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
